                <p>The OPUS MAGNUM STUDIOS is owned and operated by a Belgian individual named Olmo Lipani, nicknamed Déhà for a long, long time, so long it became a second name.</p>
                <p>Born in 1985, he discovered music at a very young age and never ever left its side. Always composing and "known" for his outstanding - maybe too big - musical output, he's a passion-driven person, bordering on obsession when it's about music.</p>
                <p>Mostly drowned into opposites music styles like Hip-Hop and Extreme Metal, he trained himself with as many instruments as he could put his hands on, but also digitally : from old trackers (OctaMED, Fast Tracker, ...) to modern DAWs (Cubase, ...), he's been making music in every possible styles and started to mix, master it despite his newbie level back then.</p>
                <p>With the willpower to do more, Déhà has learnt a lot on his own about music, musicology, theory, mixing, mastering, arrangements and everything offered on this website.</p>
                <p>Now with the OPUS MAGNUM STUDIOS unleashed, he can finally showcase more and more of what he was born to do :<br>
                    Music, in all its forms. And crafting the perfect sound for bands.</p>

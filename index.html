                <p>The OPUS MAGNUM STUDIO is held by a Belgian individual named Olmo Lipani, nicknamed Déhà for a long, long time it became a second name.</p>
                <p>Born in 1985, he discovered music at a very young age and never ever left its side. Always composing and 'known' for his outstanding - maybe too big - musical output, he's a passion-driven person to the corner of obsession when it's about music.</p>
                <p>Mostly drowned into opposites music styles like Hip-Hop and Extreme Metal, he trained himself with as many instruments he could put his hands on, but also digitally : from old trackers (OctaMED, Fast Tracker, ...) to modern DAWs (Cubase, ...), he's been making music in every possible styles and started to mix, master it considering his newbie level.</p>
                <p>With the willpower to do more, Déhà has learnt a lot on his own about music, musicology, theory, mixing, mastering, arrangements and everything offered on this website.</p>
                <p>Now with the OPUS MAGNUM STUDIO unleashed, he can finally showcase more and more of what he was born to do :<br>
                    Music, in all its forms and crafting the perfect sound for bands.</p>
